# Constraints and Report Cleaner

## Description
This project is a Perl Script on a .sdc file. The script parses throught the lines in it using regex, and displays info on all of the clocks being used and their respective periods. In addition, it also checks for slack violations, giving a warning if there is a negative value. 

Although the sdc file was created, this script could be modified to work on larger scale projects.
